# Tools
The only tool for the moment is
- a __Teleport__:
  - You select an actors place your cursor elsewhere and press Shift+T to teleport!

I had to extend Python with a little C++ function to get the mosue position in world from the viewport/camera. All the rest of the logic is done in Blueprint(Toolbox class).

# Version

This toolset contains a small Python librairy built with Unreal Editor __5.5.4__.
Source is there anaway, build it with your preferable version or ask if you want other version built, I can help.

# Install

Copy paste __*Content*__ & __*Plugins*__ folders in your Unreal Project.</br>
