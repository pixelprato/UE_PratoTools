# Tools
The only tool for the moment is
- a Teleport:
  - You select an actors place your cursor elsewhere and press Shift+T to teleport!

I had to extend Python with a little C++ function to get the mosue position in world from the viewport/camera. All the rest of the logic is done in Blueprint(Toolbox class).

# Version

This tools contain a small Python librairy built with Unreal Editor 5.5.4.
Source is there anaway, build it with your preferable version or ask if you want me to build it with different version, I can help.

# Install

Copy paste _Content_ & _Plugins_ folders in your Unreal Project.</br>
Re-open your project and verify that you have ToolBox of Unreal checked and my PratoPyLib in _Edit / Plugins_.
